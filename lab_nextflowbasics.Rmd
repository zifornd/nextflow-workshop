Nextflow is a domain specific language (DSL) implemented on top of the Groovy programming language, which in turn is a super-set of the Java programming language. This means that Nextflow can run any Groovy or Java code.

# Variables

To define a variable, simply assign a value to it:


```{r,child="assets/footer-lab.Rmd"}
```
